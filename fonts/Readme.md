All fonts used by model generators go here. Fonts should be in any format supported by [pdfkit](https://github.com/devongovett/pdfkit) (*otf* and *ttf* are recommended).

One font, *document_font*, __must__ be present here. It can be any supported font renamed as *document_font* (without extension!). This is a basic font utilised in the page title and footer. 

Specific custom fonts used by generators can be found in [pa_fonts](https://github.com/SirGagarin/pa_fonts) repository (FontForge projects).
